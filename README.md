# Vulnerable-API
A Deliberate Vulnerable API written in C# with ASP.NET Core 3 for learning API Security. This API is created purely for learning purpose. My own penetration testing experience and OWASP API Top 10 2019 inspired me to develop this API. Refer my post https://infosecraj.com/blog/vulnerable-api.html on how to install the API and start hacking.
